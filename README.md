# lattice-model-explain-grid

`lattice-model-explain-grid` explores ml utilities in Haskell. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Lattice Model Explain Grid Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Why This Exists

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Feature Notes

- Models feature signals with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep metric checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for windowed behavior, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents explainable outputs tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Implementation Notes

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying ml utilities behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Haskell code keeps the pure scoring function isolated so tests can check it without setup.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Local Setup

Use a normal shell with Haskell available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Example Scenarios

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Boundaries

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Roadmap

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more ml utilities fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
